                <p><b>Managed Accounts</b> has 30 billion reasons to celebrate. With that number in assets under management as of October 2015, the Managed Accounts platform, comprising both the Portfolio Advisor (PA) and Private Asset Management (PAM) solutions, has experienced significant growth since inception. PA, first launched in 2009, now manages more than 50,000 client accounts while PAM, started in 1998, currently manages 11,000 client accounts.</p>
<p>The TIAA-CREF Managed Accounts team works hard to help turn financial plans into reality for both clients and TIAA colleagues. Our financial professionals apply a seasoned investment approach tailored to each individual’s unique situation, helping them to look forward to and pursue a lifetime of financial well-being with a potential reduction in unintended outcomes.<p>
<p><b>Portfolio Advisor Program</b> focuses a client’s personal investment preferences in the creation of a portfolio that reflects his or her specific financial goals. For those with more complex needs the Private Asset Management program offers the support of a dedicated portfolio manager as well as Trust Services. Once a client enrolls in either program, our investment professionals manage the portfolio - including initial and ongoing investment selection and periodic rebalancing to help keep the portfolio on track.  The exceptional growth of our Managed Accounts business is testament to our increasingly unique and compelling position in the marketplace; said Eric Jones, Senior Managing Director of Advisory Solutions. By integrating our offer of professional investment management with fundamental client preferences, we are strengthening trusted client relationships and driving holistic and sustainable business growth.<p>
